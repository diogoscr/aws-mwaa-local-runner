# About aws-mwaa-local-runner

#### Step one: Building the Docker image

Build the Docker container image using the following command:

```bash
./mwaa-local-env build-image
```

**Note**: it takes several minutes to build the Docker image locally.

#### Step two: Running Apache Airflow

##### Local runner

Runs a local Apache Airflow environment that is a close representation of MWAA by configuration.

```bash
./mwaa-local-env start
```

To stop the local environment, Ctrl+C on the terminal and wait till the local runner and the postgres containers are stopped.

#### Step three: Accessing the Airflow UI

By default, the `bootstrap.sh` script creates a username and password for your local Airflow environment.

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `test`

#### Airflow UI

- Open the Apache Airlfow UI: <http://localhost:8080/>.

### Step four: Add DAGs and supporting files

The following section describes where to add your DAG code and supporting files. We recommend creating a directory structure similar to your MWAA environment.

#### DAGs

1. Add DAG code to the `dags/` folder.
2. To run the sample code in this repository, see the `example_dag_with_taskflow_api.py` file.

#### Requirements.txt

1. Add Python dependencies to `requirements/requirements.txt`.  
2. To test a requirements.txt without running Apache Airflow, use the following script:

```bash
./mwaa-local-env test-requirements
```

```bash
./mwaa-local-env package-requirements
```

For example usage see [Installing Python dependencies using PyPi.org Requirements File Format Option two: Python wheels (.whl)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/best-practices-dependencies.html#best-practices-dependencies-python-wheels).

#### Custom plugins

- There is a directory at the root of this repository called plugins. 
- In this directory, create a file for your new custom plugin.
- Add any Python dependencies to `requirements/requirements.txt`.

**Note**: this step assumes you have a DAG that corresponds to the custom plugin. For example usage [MWAA Code Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/sample-code.html).

#### Startup script

- There is a sample shell script `startup.sh` located in a directory at the root of this repository called `startup_script`.
- If there is a need to run additional setup (e.g. install system libraries, setting up environment variables), please modify the `startup.sh` script.
- To test a `startup.sh` without running Apache Airflow, use the following script:

```bash
./mwaa-local-env test-startup-script
```
